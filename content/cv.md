<small>- Even [DOCX](/cv/Peter_Boling_Resume_2023.03.25.docx) (Word Open XML Format Document file) if that's your thing.  It's not my thing.  Might have ugly formatting.</small>

I wrote a [gem to automate](https://rubygems.org/gems/undrive_google) export, renaming, and transforming, of these resume file formats from the original Google Document.  Obviously, I called it "undrive_google".
