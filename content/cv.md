### I build things out of bits

I am exploring new opportunities that can match my passion for efficiency and process iteration. I have accomplished all that I set out to in the contracting role I have had at Intricately for the past 18 months. For my next position I hope to find a long-term, full-time, role where I can roll up my sleeves and dedicate myself to building, or improving upon, a solid backend system, as an architect, or building a team to do so, as a team lead.

### About Me

Experienced system architect, team leader, mentor, rubyist, and full stack web application programmer since 2004; sometime linux system administrator.

Author and maintainer of many popular open source libraries [![On RubyGems](https://img.shields.io/gem/u/pboling.svg)](https://rubygems.org/profiles/pboling).

I excel at data analysis, task automation, testing, style guides, best practices, API design, benchmarking, and Domain Driven Design.

Created solutions for finance, social networking, government, information technology, B2B, fashion, gaming, publishing, and e-commerce sectors.

Dedicated to moving science forward and improving the condition of life generally by automation and process improvement.

My [public calendar is available](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=peter.boling%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles), so you can know when I am available.  I am always happy to chat about tech, and have advised many companies on a wide range of issues from development to infrastructure.

I am a political activist advocating for equality for all [![On RubyGems](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/galtzo.svg?style=social&label=Follow)](http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=galtzo).
