Ruby app loading slowly, or never?

Discover bootstrapping issues in Ruby by benchmarking "Kernel.require"

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'require_bench'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install require_bench

## Usage

Require the library where it will be loaded prior to any other requires you want to benchmark.

```ruby
require 'require_bench'
```

By default this gem does **nothing**, hacks **nothing**, and has **zero** effects.

### Turn on benchmarking & output

Add an environment variable, however you normally do such things, so that in Ruby:

```ruby
ENV['REQUIRE_BENCH'] == 'true'
```

Any value other than `'true'` means RubyBench is still turned off.

### Handy Rake Task for Rails:

Require in Rakefile, as follows:

```ruby
  require 'bundler/setup'
  require 'require_bench/tasks' # Near the top, just below require 'bundler/setup'!
```

This will ensure it will load before other stuff.

When running from command line, you will see output as the Rails app boots.
```bash
âˆ´ REQUIRE_BENCH=true bundle exec rake require_bench:hello

### Output Options

If the output is too noisy from deep libraries you can add a regex to skip benchmarking of files that match.

If the value is set in the shell, it should be a string.  RequireBench will split the string by comma, Regexp escape each value, and join together with pipe (`|`) to form the regex pattern.

```bash
export REQUIRE_BENCH_SKIP_PATTERN=activesupport,rspec
```

If the `ENV['REQUIRE_BENCH_SKIP_PATTERN']` value is set in Ruby, it can be one of:
  * a string, to be split by comma, each Regexp escaped, then joined by pipe (`|`)
  * an array of strings, each to be Regexp escaped, then joined by pipe (`|`)
  * a Regexp object, which will be used as is.

```ruby
ENV['REQUIRE_BENCH_SKIP_PATTERN'] = 'activesupport,rspec'
# or
ENV['REQUIRE_BENCH_SKIP_PATTERN'] = [ 'activesupport', 'rspec' ]
# or
ENV['REQUIRE_BENCH_SKIP_PATTERN'] = Regexp.new('activesupport|rspec')
```

Any file being required that matches the pattern will use the standard, rather than the benchmarked, require.

#### Fully qualified paths

Fully qualified paths, or any portion thereof, are fine, because the strings are always Regexp escaped.
