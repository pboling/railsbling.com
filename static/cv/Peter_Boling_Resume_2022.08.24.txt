Since 2013 I have been helping refugees from Ivory Coast and Liberian civil wars re-establish themselves.  Initially I rent apartments for refugees, purchase land, build cinder block homes, help them repatriate, find gainful employment, and build sufficiency by farming and husbandry.  Refugees who cannot repatriate I help relocate to permanent new lives through UN programs, mostly to Canada and Australia.  November 2015 my efforts became a registered Liberian NGO called Hope For Tomorrow.  Each year I directly assist hundreds of refugees to repatriate or relocate.
